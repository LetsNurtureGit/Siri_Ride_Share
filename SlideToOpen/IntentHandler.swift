         Some helpful tips on INListRideOptionsIntentResponseCodes:
         
         - case unspecified
         - Don't use this, it is considered a failure.
         - case ready
         - Don't use this, it is considered a failure.
         - case inProgress
         - Don't use this, it is considered a failure.
         - case success
         - Use this for when there are valid ride options you wish to display.
         - case failure
         - Use this when there is a failure.
         - case failureRequiringAppLaunch
         - Use this when there is a failure which can be recovered from, but only by switching to your parent app.
         - case failureRequiringAppLaunchMustVerifyCredentials
         - Use this when a user is not logged in or signed up for your service in your parent app.
         - case failureRequiringAppLaunchNoServiceInArea
         - Use this when you definitively don't offer service in the general area the user requested ride options in.
         - case failureRequiringAppLaunchServiceTemporarilyUnavailable
         - Use this when you temporarily don't offer service in the general area, for example if there are no vehicles available.
         - case failureRequiringAppLaunchPreviousRideNeedsCompletion
         - Use this when there was a previous ride in your service that the user needs to complete in your parent app. For example if the user still needs to pay for the previous ride. If there is a previous ride that needs completion, but you would still like to allow the user to book another ride, return .success.
         
         For the cases requiringAppLaunch, make sure to include a relevant user activity. This activity will be continued in your parent app if the user chooses to take action on the failure message in Maps.
